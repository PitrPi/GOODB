# GOODB: Generic Object Oriented Deck Building

This project started because I wanted to have generic skeleton, that can be used for implemeting various modern board games with deck building mechanic. E.g. Dominion, Trains, Automobiles, and so on.

The final version is meant for players to be played on their handheld, while server on common screen shows public information, such as current available cards to buy, board,..

The secondary reason for this project is for me to get used to object orienting programing in Python. If any readers of this text should find any approaches used in this project non-pythonic, I'd love to hear your opinion or merge any changes that would improve this project, as long as reasoning for this change is provided.
